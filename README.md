# mit-6.172: Performance Engineering and Systems
Project-based introduction to building efficient, high-performance and scalable software systems. Topics include performance analysis, algorithmic techniques for high performance, instruction-level optimizations, vectorization, cache and memory hierarchy optimization, and parallel programming.

I completed the coursework available on MIT's OpenCourseWare in the Winter of 2021.
